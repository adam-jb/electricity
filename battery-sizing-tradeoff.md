# UK Battery Sizing Trade-off: 3.68kW (G98) vs Larger (G99)

## Key Distinction

- **3.68kW** = power rating (charge/discharge speed)
- **10kWh** = capacity (energy stored)

G98 limit is on **inverter output power**, not battery capacity. You can have a 10kWh battery with a 3.68kW inverter - it just cycles slower.

## Impact on Arbitrage Income

The business plan assumes:
- 10kWh battery with ~5kW inverter
- 2-hour charge window (cheapest 4 half-hours)
- 2-hour discharge window (most expensive 4 half-hours)

### With 3.68kW inverter:

| Metric | 5kW inverter | 3.68kW inverter | Difference |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Time to cycle 10kWh | 2 hours | **2.7 hours** | +42% |
| kWh in 2-hour optimal window | 10kWh | **7.4kWh** | -26% |
| Half-hours needed for 10kWh | 4 | **6** | +50% |

---

## Configuration Options

### Option A: 10kWh battery + 3.68kW inverter (G98)

- Need 6 half-hours instead of 4 to fully cycle
- 5th & 6th cheapest half-hours = higher buy price (~2-3p more)
- 5th & 6th most expensive half-hours = lower sell price (~3-5p less)
- **Result: ~85-90% of calculated income**

### Option B: 7.4kWh battery + 3.68kW inverter (G98)

- Full optimal 2-hour windows retained
- But 26% less energy throughput
- **Result: ~74% of calculated income**

### Option C: 10kWh battery + 5kW inverter (G99 required)

- Full optimal windows + full capacity
- **Result: 100% of calculated income**
- **Cost: 4-6 month G99 approval per installation**

## Financial Comparison

| Configuration | Annual profit/unit | vs Baseline |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 10kWh + 5kW (G99) | £887 | 100% |
| 10kWh + 3.68kW (G98) | **£750-800** | 85-90% |
| 7.4kWh + 3.68kW (G98) | **£650** | 74% |

## At Scale: Revenue vs Regulatory Cost

| Scale | Lost revenue (G98 vs G99) | G99 costs avoided | G99 time avoided |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 100 units | £8.7-13.7k/year | £30-75k | 4-6 months |
| 1,000 units | £87-137k/year | £300-750k | Years of bottleneck |
| 10,000 units | £870k-1.37M/year | £3-7.5M | Impractical at scale |

---

## Recommendation

**Use 3.68kW (G98) for speed-to-scale.**

The G99 bottleneck costs more than the lost arbitrage:
- G99 = 4-6 month approval **per installation**
- At 1,000 units: years of delays + £300-750k in application fees
- Lost arbitrage (~10-15%) is acceptable trade-off

Only consider G99 route if:
- Targeting customers with existing solar (often already G99 approved)
- Specific high-usage customers where extra capacity justified
- Regulatory environment changes (G99 processing speeds up)
